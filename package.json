List should include projects to encompass todos, with a default one to store default todos.\r 1. Separate application logic from DOM-related stuff in different modules.\r 1. User interface should be able to view all projects, view all todos in each project (title and dueDate), expand a single todo to see/edit its details, and delete a todo.\r 1. Use localStorage to save user projects between sessions.\r 1. Use outside libraries with webpack",
