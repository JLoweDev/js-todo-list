# js-todo-list

## Project Goals

1. Sort out simple HTML for a header with title, nav with projects and todos, and simple footer.
1. Style the HTML.
1. Todos must be stored as objects, using factories/classes/constructors to create them.
1. Should include a title, description, dueDate, priority, notes, and checklist.
1. List should include projects to encompass todos, with a default one to store default todos.
1. Separate application logic from DOM-related stuff in different modules.
1. User interface should be able to view all projects, view all todos in each project (title and dueDate), expand a single todo to see/edit its details, and delete a todo.
1. Use localStorage to save user projects between sessions.
